# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in any data science workflow.
This project demonstrates how to:

Understand the structure of a dataset

Detect missing values and outliers

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Analyze numerical and categorical features

Visualize distributions, trends, and correlations

Summarize actionable insights

The goal is to turn raw data into a structured understanding using Python.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains multiple numerical and categorical features relevant for analysis.
(If you want, I can update this section with exact column names after you share them.)

🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

Checked dataset shape

Identified missing values

Handled duplicates

Converted data types (e.g., dates, categories, numeric fields)

Removed irrelevant or redundant columns

Treated outliers using statistical methods

Encoded categorical variables

Standardized or normalized numeric features (optional)

Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA includes:

🔹 Univariate Analysis

Distribution of numerical columns

Count plots for categorical variables

Summary statistics

🔹 Bivariate Analysis

Relationship between numerical variables

Categorical vs numerical analysis

Heatmaps for correlation

🔹 Multivariate Analysis

Pairplots

Group-wise comparisons

Trend identification

Visualizations Used

Histograms

Countplots

Boxplots (for outlier detection)

Heatmap (correlation)

Bar charts

Line plots

Scatter plots

All visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
